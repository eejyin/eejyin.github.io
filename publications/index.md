Since my sophomore year in <a href="./#ncepu"> North China Electrical Power University (NCEPU)</a>, I joined <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37404367100" title="Prof. Zhou in IEEEXplore" target="_blank">Prof. Zhenyu Zhou</a>'s Lab and actively participated in scientific research. After that, my undergraduate thesis, titled "Research on Multi-energy Flow Interactive Coupling Characteristics and Optimal Scheduling of Integrated Energy System", was completed under the guidance of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37589545400" title="Prof. Zeng in IEEEXplore" target="_blank">Prof. Bo Zeng</a>. In 2020, through the exam-free postgraduate recommendation, I entered Southeast University, supervised by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085418471" title="Prof. Wang in IEEEXplore" target="_blank">Prof. Jianhua Wang</a>.


Here you should be able to find everything you need to know to accomplish the most common tasks when blogging with Hydejack.
Should you think something is missing, [please let me know](mailto:mail@qwtel.com).
Should you discover a mistake in the docs (or a bug in general) feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack/issues) on GitHub.

While this manual tries to be beginner-friendly, as a user of Jekyll it is assumed that you are comfortable running shell commands and editing text files.
