# Frontiers in Energy Research - Integrated Energy System Optimal Operation in Coal District With Hydrogen Heavy Trucks

## Highlights

* The application feasibility of **hydrogen heavy trucks** is discussed, in the typical scenario of coal districts.
* Hydrogen production becomes **renewable** by absorbing wind power, combining P2G with coal gasification.
* The efficient **closed loop** of hydrogen energy from generation to utilization is proposed.
* The economy and low-carbon properties of the proposed **integrated electric-gas system** mechanism are analyzed.

As shown in Figure 1, the **closed industrial loop** between coal mining, hydrogen production, truck transportation of coal, and integrated energy systems has been innovatively proposed. In the coal mining process, part of the coal is used to produce hydrogen through **C2H technology**, and the other part is transported to power plants by **hydrogen heavy trucks**, which consume a lot of energy in the transportation process. Wind power is highly volatile and cannot be directly connected to the grid. Therefore, wind power produces **hydrogen** (energy for hydrogen heavy trucks) through electrolysis of water, and part of the hydrogen is further methanated to produce **methane** (injected into natural gas pipelines). Note that in this article, only the daily operating emissions (variable cost) is considered, and the emissions caused by the initial equipment investment (fixed cost) are not considered. Among them, coal is used for hydrogen production or transportation, and wind power is used for hydrogen production or methanation. By combining the needs of the coupled energy network, real-time optimized dispatching is carried out.

## Abstract


The coal industry contributes significantly to the social economy, but the emission of greenhouse gases puts huge pressure on the environment in the process of mining, transportation, and power generation. In the integrated energy system (IES), the current research about the **power-to-gas (P2G)** technology mainly focuses on the injection of hydrogen generated from renewable energy electrolyzed water into natural gas pipelines, which may cause hydrogen embrittlement of the pipeline and cannot be repaired. In this paper, sufficient hydrogen energy can be produced through P2G technology and **coal-to-hydrogen (C2H)** of coal gasification, considering the typical scenario of coal district is rich in coal and renewable energy. In order to transport the mined coal to the destination, hydrogen heavy trucks have a broad space for development, which can absorb hydrogen energy in time and avoid potentially dangerous hydrogen injection into pipelines and relatively expensive hydrogen storage. An optimized scheduling model of electric-gas IES is proposed based on **second-order cone programming (SOCP)**. In the model proposed above, the closed industrial loop (including coal mining, hydrogen production, truck transportation of coal, and integrated energy systems) has been innovatively studied, to consume renewable energy and coordinate multi-energy. Finally, an electric-gas IES study case constructed by **IEEE 30-node power system and Belgium 24-node natural gas network** was used to analyze. The results show that by introducing the proposed hydrogen production technology, typical daily operating costs are effectively reduced by 7.7%. Under China’s **carbon emissions trading** system, the operating costs of hydrogen heavy trucks have been reduced by 0.95 and 4.68% respectively, compared with electric vehicles and diesel trucks. Under Europe’s stricter carbon emissions trading system, the percentages of cost reduction are 2.56 and 9.12%, respectively. The above technical results verify the **feasibility, economy, low carbon, and effectiveness** of the proposed mechanism.
